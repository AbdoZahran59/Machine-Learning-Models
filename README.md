# Machine-Learning-Models
A Repo For Multiple Machine Learning Models


A repo for multiple ML models I've built in the past couple of months , implemented in two ways : from scratch using numpy and using keras for faster implementation -Linear Regression -Binary Classification -Multiclass Classification -Multilabel Classification -Deep Neural Network Digit Recognition -LeNet5 Digit Recognition -RNN Digit Recognition -Seq2Seq Translation Model
